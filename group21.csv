Timestamp,,"Group work in major classes is useful for my career, because it makes me gain a lot of skill",APU professors have enough methodological skills,I am satisfied with content of the major classes and I think they will be useful in my after university life, I think liberal art subjects are helpful for me, I think most of APU students study Japanese language only for their future career,on line learning is much more useful than classes at APU,,
